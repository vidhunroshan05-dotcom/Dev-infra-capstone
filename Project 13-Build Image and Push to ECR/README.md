# Project 13 – Build Image and Push to Amazon ECR

## Goal

Publish a Dockerized application to a container registry by building a Docker image and pushing it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

---

## Description

In this project, a simple Flask application was containerized using Docker.

The Docker image was built locally, tagged appropriately, and pushed to an Amazon ECR repository.

This demonstrates how container images are published to a cloud registry for later deployment in cloud environments.

---

## Tasks Completed

* Created a Dockerfile for the Flask application
* Built the Docker image locally
* Created an Amazon ECR repository
* Authenticated Docker with Amazon ECR
* Tagged and pushed the Docker image to ECR


---

## Outcome

The Docker image is now stored securely in Amazon ECR and ready to be deployed to services such as ECS or Kubernetes.
