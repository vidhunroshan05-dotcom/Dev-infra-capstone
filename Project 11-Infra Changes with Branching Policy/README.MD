# Project 11 – Infrastructure Changes with Branching Policy

## Goal

Follow a branching strategy for infrastructure changes using Git.

---

## Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of infrastructure changes using a **feature branch workflow**.

Instead of making direct changes to the `main` branch, a dedicated feature branch was created to ensure proper version control practices.

The changes were reviewed and merged into the `main` branch through a Pull Request (PR), following standard DevOps branching and collaboration practices.

---

## Workflow Followed

1. Created a feature branch from `main`
2. Made an infrastructure-related change
3. Committed and pushed changes to the remote repository
4. Raised a Pull Request
5. Reviewed and merged the Pull Request into `main`
